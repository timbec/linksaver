This is a potential prototype for two separate apps - a link saver for myself and my wife and a photo sharing application for my larger family. 

the link saver is based on the old Delicious link saving site. Ideally, the user can save links, add tags or categories for later filtering. Links can also be deleted. 

Users will also have the ability to share links. 

Users will sign in, create an account, and upload content. I will likely restrict people's access in order to keep the site private.
